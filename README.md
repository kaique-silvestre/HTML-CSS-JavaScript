This repository contains the code from my studies using the “Curso em Vídeo” materials. The HTML and CSS folders represent my very first contact with the world of development — a nostalgic and important phase for me. I remember the feelings of fear, frustration, and difficulty I faced while being introduced to this field, but also the sense of achievement and satisfaction that came with learning and progressing. After so much time and effort, it's meaningful to look back and see how far I’ve come. The repository also includes a folder with my JavaScript studies, done some time after those initial steps.
